# Digital-and-Computer-Systems

Contains **some** of the lab work from my digital logic and computer organization course (ESC253). <br />
The labs in this course were done using SystemVerilog and RISC-V assembly languages and an FPGA board. Labs included tasks such as implementing basic circuits, muxes, displays, flip-flops, registers, counters, finite state machines, recursion in assembly, etc. <br /> <br />
**Only a very small portion of material is presented to prevent plagirism.** <br />
